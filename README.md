## Features

This package detects microphone input and coverts it to text using [Google's Speech Recognition API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text). It then opens ChatGPT and inputs the recognized text.

It can be used with a wake word, and it can also use text to speech to repeat ChatGPT's answer to the query. These arguements are specified in the creation of the class (see **Getting Started**)
